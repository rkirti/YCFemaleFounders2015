- Applications for the next YC batch are open. 
Q: What makes a good YC batch and interview? 
- Ability to articulate your idea in a very concise manner. 
- Love to a problem that is hugely broken, with a huge opportunity, and you are
a domain expert in that area. 
- Previous applications link available on YC's twitter. 

Q: What are you looking for in non-profits' applications?
- Been working with non-profits for 3 batches. 
- Look for the exact same things in a non-profit team as they would in a
for-profit team. 

Q: In the past few years, YC's gotten a lot more hardware/health/biotech startups? 
Their growth timelines are much longer.
- 2 batches since they've done biotech. They've worked on some key milestones 
that define the value of the company. 

Q: Co-founding a company with your spouses? 
- Jessica: So many of the people we fund are husband-wives. 
I love working with my husband - we didn't do the same things, we weren't competitive 
and that helped. 
- Do a test run working together - if you're sniping at each other, don't do it. 
- Caroline: YC's other lawyer is my husband. We talk about YC all the time. 
- Tracy from PlanGrid mentioned that she and her husband impose an 8.30
deadline, when they stop talking about PlanGrid. 

Q: Equity split between cofounders? 
- Should be split more or less equally. 

Q: Do you see women founders founding different types of companies or solving 
different kinds of problems? 
- No. 

Q: What are you most excited about in getting more women to apply to YC? 
- Jessica: More successful female founders! More role-models for 15 year olds
or recent college grads. More role models who are female founding CEOs of tech 
companies. 

Q: I am technical enough to build an early prototype and get some customers. 
Thoughts? 
- We don't do single founders usually. Reasons:
a. Theres too much work to do in a startup. 
b. There are too many emotional ups and downs - you cant handle that on your own. 

Q: What is the average age of YC founders? Can we do YC as parents? 
- Moderator: Average age is around 30. Youngest is 20 and oldest is in his sixties. 
- Jessica: Used to be 26. I did a couple of years ago, look at the top companies
in terms of valuations, - the age when we funded them was 24. 
- Moderator: Susan Johnson from today's talk earlier is a mom. 

Q: I struggle with self-promotion and taking responsibility for my talents? 
How can  I get out of my own way? 
- Jessica: We funded someone who was doing some cool biotech/healthcare stuff
out of her PhD, and she pitched well on demo day, but she never mentioned  that it 
was she who invented it!

Q: What is your favorite part of working at YC? 
- Lawyer: I used to work at a big law firm. I wake up so happy everyday that I
work at YC. I work with wonderful people who are super-smart. 
- Jessica: Main reason I do what I do is that I love working with founders. Its
fun seeing companies succeed. 
- Non-profit partner: I worked on the outskirts but attended every single dinner 
in the last 10 years. What attracted me was the energy of the room during those 
Tuesday night dinners. 
- Moderator: I used to work at Wired magazine. I love working with these
entrepreneurs who are building the future every day. Community is now over 
2000 founders.
