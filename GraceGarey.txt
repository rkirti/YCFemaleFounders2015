- Co-founder of Watsi -  lets you donate money for healthcar for people who
can't afford it. 

- Motivation: Heard stories of people who couldn't eat, couldn't get healthcare
etc. She wanted to know more about the lives of these people, but didn't know how to help. 

- Joined a non-profit in DC: Learnt this: "Nonprofits end up serving the donors
who give them money, rather than serving the people they exist to help."

- The donor her non-profit was talking to, had specific interests of their own,
and tied what they could do with the money.

- Upto 94% of the money raised for the Haiti earthquake never made it there. 

- She went to India, to a "Swami Vivekanand Youth Movement", a hospital started
by two doctors. Saw that they were actually doing good work, one reason being that 
they were physically close to the people they were serving. 

-We are quickly on our way to a world where every single person is connected -
why is the process of funding people so amorphous/hazy then? 

- Early Watsi team brainstormed across 6 continents / 8 time-zones. 

Decisions made in early days that shaped Watsi:
-----------------------------------------------
a. 100% of donations would make it to the recipients. 
b. Transparency:
c. Golden rule: Treat people as you want to be treated yourself. 

What got them traction
--------------------
- Sent it to Hacker News. 20k traffic instantly and they got funded 
for every single patient that they had on their site. They funded 10 patients 
in their first couple of hours. 
- Techcrunch / HuffPost / FastCompany all picked them up. With every press 
release, they kept running out of patients. 
- They had an extremely inefficient process of listing new patients. 

- Fun anecdote: Entered an online voting contest to get 10k in funding. 
Minutes close to finish of the contest, she got a bar's bouncer to make 
people vote for Watsi before they entered the bar!

- PG invited Watsi to be the first non-profit for YC.
- Surprising thing about YC: Everybody was making a big bet on the future. 
- Surround yourself with people who just light up when they talk about 
what they work on.

- Stats: 4000 patients funded in 20 countries. 
- Raised $3.5mn -  100% of which has gone to help who it was supposed to help.
