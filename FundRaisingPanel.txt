Theme: How to raise money 

Panelists:
========
- Susan Johnson - women.com, Q&A platform for women only. Raised $1.5mn. 
- Mathilde - Front, 
- Maran Nelson - Clara Labs, cannot disclose how much they raised and from whom. 
- Nancy Hua - Apptimize, raised ($2mn?) 

- Susan: First person she spoke to was her husband who was also a founder. 
  - Best substitute for not having a founder partner is to have a mentor who can 
  be that safezone. 
  - Fundraising is a "process", a "manufactured schedule" - find someone who
  understands that process. 

- Nancy Hua: 
- Raising the seed is totally different from raising Series A. 
- She realized during Series A about how wrong she was about their seed. 

Q: How do you strategize? Figure out whom to pitch? 
- Mathilde: Got the founder of Keynote(?) to invest, and that got them good
signalling. (Front is about shared inboxes)
- Susan: Same trick as sales (think of it as a funnel - get as many 
meetings as possible, going through a ton of no's to get to the final yes). 

Q: How do you get through the first meeting? 
- Maran: Relied on Danielle to meet with an investor. (Takeaway: lean in on your
network).
- Two things that are important: 
(a) Knowing that what you are doing is good. Very few actually believe what they 
are doing is great. Prove it to yourself. 
(b) Have traction. Prove it to other people. 
Get (a) and (b) right and rest is icing on the cake. 

Q: How did YC help in the fundraising? 
- Mathilde: Raised in France before raising here. YC is useful for folks not
coming from the valley - gives you an image, and connections. 
- Some YC partners also invest. 
- Susan: YC puts founders in a position of power during demo day - there are  
50 odd top VCs there to invest, and it puts the founder in a strong position. 

Q: (To Nancy): How did your strong personality help in fundraising? 
- Prioritized based on who was likely to put in money, and who would 
put in more money. 
- Steered the conversation back at several points, when she felt she was getting
 weird questions not relevant to why the investment should be made. 
 - All seed investors - closed during the first meeting. 
 - She would ask upfront "How much do you want to invest?" and end the meeting
 in the first meeting itself. 
 - Nancy herself angel invests in some companies - her friends pitch to her, 
 and she can tell when her friends are deviating from the main topic 
 and taking up follow-up meetings. 
 - Follow-up meetings are a waste of time.

Q: How big was your team when you were fundraising? Did you communicate 
every detail of the process to the whole team? 
- Mathilde: In the beginning, I shared only the good news. Realized soon 
that this doesn't work.

Q: Did you have PR? 
- Maran: Decided not to share investors' details with press on demo day. Wanted 
to make it more about their company/product/team.
