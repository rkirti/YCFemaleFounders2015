Lessons learnt along the way
==========================
1. Do what matters the most. 
   - Jim Collins calls this "defining your values". 
2. "The work of your life is to discover your purpose and get on 
    with the business of living it out." - Oprah Winfrey
    - She was only to divert her daughter from spending every weekend
    at the computer game shop.
3. She changed from a for-profit to a non-profit company (influenced by 
   what?)
4. Have a reckless disregard for the impossible 
    - It took her nearly 25 years to recognize that she wasn't a good corporate 
    employee. 
    - They expanded to 6 cities in 1.5-2 months in 2012. They had set a goal for 200,  
    but ended up reaching a 1000. 
5. "Surround yourself only with people who are going to take you higher."
    - Oprah Winfrey 
    - You are the driver as the CEO/founder but its your responsibility to 
    pick the right folks on the seats of the bus. Everyone wants to ride on the bus, 
    but few are prepared for the hardwork/challenges.
6. "Follow your passion" - Oprah. 
   "If you don't know what your passion is, realize that one reason for your existence 
    on earth is to find it."
