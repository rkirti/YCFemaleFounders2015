- Tracy Young: co-founder of PlanGrid, a place in the cloud where
most construction managers store their blueprints. 
- 2010: She was a new graduate with a construction management degree. 
- Her first project was 4000 sqft of medical office space. 
- QA/QC in construction is much like QA in software - you confirm what 
was built was right, mark issues on blueprints etc. 
- "We've built the wrong thing everywhere." Turns out we are not incompetent
builders, its just that the blueprints are constantly changing and its easy
to build based on outdating drawings. 
- 10k+ paying customers, construction industry's favorite construction app
- 200k+ projects have been built with PlanGrid. 
- 17mn+ blueprints in their cloud. 
- PlanGrid is 92 people and actively hiring. 
- She ordered extra blueprints for her colleagues and realized a week later - 
that they cost $28k. She consulted her friend asking him how to pay for this
and he cursed things saying "this should be in the cloud"
- 2 domain experts, great idea, no technical co-founder. At this point, this was
a pretty standard Silicon Valley story. 
- Her boyfriend worked at Pixar before joining the team of 2 construction 
management folks. He learnt about the company because he was sharing Google
calendars' with Tracy.

Best advice ever given to Tracy Young 
=======================================
- By Antoine
- 1. Life is short. 
- 2. Take care of the ones you love. Your company will be all-consuming, 
     It will be easy to blame it on the company. 
     As soon as you realize you need time with loved ones, pick up the phone. 
- 3. Don't be afraid to try new things. 
- 4. Never do anything that makes you unhappy.
     A startup will take you through the highest of high and lowest of lows
     in the same hour! She finds this a roller-coaster ride even with an 
     amazingly supportive co-founder/husband.
- If you are not happy doing something, you will compromise too much and you'll 
  kill yourself trying. 

Advice she would give herself from 4 years ago
=======================================
- 1. Be a Beaver. 
-    They are nice vegetarian builders :-) 
     Everything's always try to eat them. People try to trap them and make things 
     out of them. The beaver protects itself by building massive dams where it puts 
     its family. Beavers are small, but they take down massive big trees. 
     "I've been gnawing at this tree for f*cking forever". But it will work hard 
     and be patient, because it doesn't want to die. THAT is what you should follow. 
-    Writing good code, fixing bugs, talking to users, selling to them and
     getting them to pay for it - the only way to get through it is hard work and patience. 
- 2. Don't Complain. 
-    The moment you stop and complain, there will be someone who comes, work
     harder than you and eat your lunch. When they realized construction people didn't 
     have iPads, they first complained. Then decided to buy 16 iPads with all their savings 
     and credit and pass those on to customers. 
-    PlanGrid does crazy, unscalable things in customer support. They obsess
     over internal policy that gets written. 
-3.  Iterate and Improve. 
     A small beaver family can build a huge dam, that protects against the millions of water flows
     every day. Beavers constantly rebuild parts of their dams. 
-    PlanGrid only has divisions (operations, engineering), but no titles. They
     continued this until 50-60 employees. Every 6 months they reinvent every single department. 
-4. Be a HoneyBadger
-   HoneyBadgers are brave and courageous - gets bitten by a deadly snake,
    passes out for 8-10 hours and then wakes up and eats that snake. 
-   They went through various phases as a company where they almost died, but
    survived. 
-5. Be Brave / Stand up for yourself 
-   HoneyBadgers take down lions by running between the lions legs and biting
    the lion in its balls. You just need to be brave. 
    She was scared starting PlanGrid - and wakes up terrified day everyday. 
-6. Support your family
-   PlanGrid team were very good at supporting each other and running in the
    same direction as a group.
-   "Business, just like nature, is relentless and unforgiving"
-   It will be rough, tough, everything will feel like its in shambles. Just
    remember to channel the beaver and honeybadger in you.
