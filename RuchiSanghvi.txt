- Facebook, Cove and Dropbox. 
- All 3 companies were different - there was no one gameplan or
formula that could have been applied to all three. 
- Chances of success are higher if you are able to work from 
first principles i.e. What are you great at? 
- Its really hard to set aside your biases and look for better solutions. 
- Will share her personal experiences about trying and not succeeding in 
thinking from first principles in all her 3 stints. 

Facebook before NewsFeed
=======================
- Barely 20 people in the audience recall FB before NewsFeed. 
- 10 million unique newspapers every single day. 
- People were afraid of losing "ad inventory", "contextual 
monetizing opportunities" because newsfeed would mean 
one single sources instead of profiles, photos etc. 

- NewsFeed became an information engine that quickly told 
what was happening in your social graph, engage with it 
and contribute back. 
- This was a product decision made from first principles i.e. it was improving 
how to socialize. 
- Original NewsFeed as built on Linux/MySQL - the architecture was done 
by 3 recent college grads. 


Story of Cove 
=============
- Decidedly lived scrappy 
- Jokingly referred to it as a sweatshop

No-Nos (learnt from Cove):
======
1. Patience
    - They were too harsh on themselves
2. Success Metrics 
    - Compared to social/local/gaming companies of the time, 
    and got impatient that they weren't growing as fast 
3. Second Company Syndrome
    - Were determined to not make the mistakes that they had made 
    at Facebook. 
    - At FB, infra was weak that it would break each time there was a 
    launch. 
    - At Cove, they focused on beautiful infra - some of their infra 
    powers Dropbox today. That was time they could have invested elsewhere. 
    - Startups have a binary outcome - chances of success are pretty low.
    You need to give yourself every advantage possible. 
    - Instead to taking advantage that they had access 
4. Marathon not sprint 
    - They worked 12-14 hours a day, not realized that they were no longer 
    the 22 year olds who worked at Facebook. 
    - They weren't thinking broadly enough and definitely not thinking 
    from first principles. 
    - They had plenty of funding available - being scrappy and working 
    from a sweatshop wasn't a good idea in hindsight.
- Every team has its strengths - identify those and you can distinguish. 
- Cove was acquired by Dropbox - they wanted to build at scale, and Dropbox 
allowed them to do that. 
5. Sweat the details, depending on the context
- Spent large amounts of time fixing bugs in Scandinavian Windows XP version 
3 - why? because this was important for a company like Dropbox, where someone 
losing their wedding photos or PhD thesis was a disaster. This was not the 
case at Facebook. 
- She learnt that Dropbox wasn't Facebook - she had to move slower than Facebook, 
because the last 10% of polish took about 50% of engineering time. 
- She realized that the only way to grow faster was to spread the team. When she 
was asked by Drew about what she wanted to work on first, she said "recruiting". 
- She was determined about growing the company from 90 to 270 in less than 7
months, for reasons explained below (more manpower helps with sweating and perfecting 
the details). 
- After hiring, she also did marketing, communications and product. Her title or
role didn't matter. Ten years from now, nobody remembers her title but her work is  
what is remembered. 

5. Baggage of success 
- Every single day someone askes her "what are you doing next?" 
- "As I think of my next venture, I am committed to staying patient, working 
from first principles."
