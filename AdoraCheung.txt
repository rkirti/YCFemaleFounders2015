- Homejoy: Been around 2.5 years. Went from 0->13 markets in under 6 months, 
  0->200 employees in under a year. 
- Last year spoke about product-market fit, that was a rough journey. 
- Today's talk: scaling of product, scaling organization and scaling and
managing yourself. 
- You dont need to scale anything until you meet some pre-requisities:
a. You only scale anything once you find product-market fit.
    - Do people actually want the product you've built? 
b. Is the opportunity big? 
c. Is the timing right? 
    - Why is it that building your business today is the correct time? 
    - Factors for homejoy (for why the timing is right):
        - Tech getting more pervasive.
        - People getting more comfortable outsourcing their lives. 
        - Freelance economy and flexible hours getting more popular. 

Scaling your product 
--------------------
Focus on three types of growth:
a. Sticky growth: Build something that pepople want to use over and over again. 
b. Viral growth: 
    - Referral programs. Incentivize users to get other users. 
    - Paid growth: Ads, billboards, build a sales team. Paid growth can make you 
    but it can also kill you. If you buy users and they dont pay back over time,
    you'll run out of money.   
c. (?) 


Scaling tools and automation:
---------------------------
- Observe what all your people are doing. What kind of tools do you need to
create out of that? 
- Instead of building your own, use 3rd party tools wherever possible. 
- E.g. Decided to build their own phone-system for their call-centers 
at Homejoy. Oops! They got more complaints for their phone-system 
than they got from their customer service reps. 


A note for the founder/CEO
---------------------------
- Over time, you will get stretched. The time you can give to different 
things will stretch. BUT, the LEVEL OF OBSESSION you have the with the 
QUALITY OF YOUR PRODUCT should not diminish. 
- She read every single review that came from customers and home-service 
owners the previous day. She sent herself every review over email - she used 
to send them to herself over text messsages until AT&T broke it (100k text 
messages per day!) 

- Be obsessed about recruiting to get A+ players. BE AS OBSESSED ABOUT 
RECRUITING AS YOU ARE ABOUT PRODUCT.
  - Get dinners and drinks for all promising candidates, for instance. 
  - She bought a ticket and went to someone's home town, to have dinner 
  with her because she wanted that candidate really bad. 
  - Do not underestimate the power of you showing up. 
 

Scaling communications
---------------------
- Communicating with your team - changes over time. 
- When things are changing - thats the time when communication is needed the
most. 
    e.g. Holding all-hands meetings once every two weeks. 
    - That broke down for them, once they had offices in Germany. 
- Build the right tools for flow of communication. 
- Mission and core values: 
    - Everyone in your company should know the mission word for word. 
    Else they are not moving in the same boat - they wont making 
    decisions the same way everyone else wants them to. 
    - Core values need to be unique to the company (not something generic 
    like honesty or innovation). 
    e.g. Homejoy has 6: 
    a. Nobody's above any job. --> Looking for people who respect all other people 
    irrespective of what job they are doing. 
    --> Every employee has to actually clean a home in first few weeks of joining. 
    b. Temporary brokenness is better than permanent paralysis. 
    --> Make a decision, go, commit, fail, do a post-mortem, come back and revise. 
    c. (Get above local maxima).
    --> Need to take risks with big decisions to become a billion dollar company.
- People are probably making suboptimal decisions with their personal life to 
work for you, as a small, fast-growing company. Respect that. 
- If you are managing and coaching correctly, firing/difficult conversations
shouldn't come out of the blue. 


Scaling/managing yourself 
-----------------------
- Being a CEO is an unruly job. 
- Need to create your own unsupport systems. Else you will keep thinking that things 
are going to fall apart in the next day, or next five seconds. 
- Keep getting feedback from other founders and other CEOs. At the very least, 
you need one person to go to. 
- Managing stress: On average, there are two great things a day and two shitty 
things a day (for her). Find that number for yourself - acknowledge when that happens 
"oh, ok, first bad thing of the day",and move on. That helps you be and stay sane. 

Managing time 
------------
- CEO at some point is caught in meetings from 7 am to midnight. You need to
start stripping those meetings. 
- Her rule: she doesn't take meetings from 7 am to 9 am. 

- tl;dr: Scaling a startup is like a really awkward car-race. You're given a scrappy 
car from a junkyard, and asked to drive it at 200 miles an hour and along the way, 
fix it!
