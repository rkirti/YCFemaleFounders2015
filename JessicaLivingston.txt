- Last year's YC statistics: %of applicants with female founders: 23%, %of selected 
companies with female founders: 23%
- YC wasn't deliberately selecting companies with women - this just goes to show that 
women are indeed capable and do better groundwork.
- Other accelerators have copied the structure of YC but they havent succeeded
in creating the culture that Jessica has created. 
- Jessica screens for character and people dynamics.
- Most applicants barely realized that she was there, but her partners turned to
her to get details on the people - how she judged them as people. 
- She is a good judge of how tough people are, whether they are good people or
not. Paul, Robert and Trevor would do the technical part and then she would 
veto based on character. 
- She would notice if the applicants were reflecting the partners' ideas
back at them. 
- Increasingly, the value of YC is in the alumni network. They are almost 2000 
companies, and they are almost all trustworthy and nurturing when dealing with 
new people. 
- YC now has 5 interview tracks. The last 20% make it to Jessica's character 
screening. 
- "Do things that don't scale" - we followed our own advice and treated founders 
as if they were our family. This was easy to do in 2007 when there were 8 companies,
difficult to do now, but it is still intimate for 116 companies.
- The first batch of startups that they funded was just for them to learn how to
be investors - they expected to lost money on it. They learnt that funding in batches 
is a good idea. This beginning (goal was to learn investing) made them more of a 
"non-profit" and has shaped their culture. 
- The lesson learnt here is that atleast early on, it pays not to focus on money 
or have it as primary goal. 
- By the time they shifted the focus to money, the idea of treating founders as
family had become ingrained in the culture. 
- YC still gives advice to startups they funded 5-8 years ago. 
- Jessica provides the social advice.
- "Most startups behind the scenes are shit-ships." They manage to conceal this
from the world. But the sort of problems Jessica helps founders with, are more 
dangerous than the technical ones. 
- Things YC does for the broader community - Paul's essays, events like Female 
Founders conference, female founders stories site, some open-source documents(?)
