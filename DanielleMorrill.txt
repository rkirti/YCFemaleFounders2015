- Mattermark, recently raised 6.5mn Series A. 
- YC Summer 2012. Been fundraising for 3 years non-stop. 
- Raised the 1st million in seed easy - raised from Michelle Goldberg (mentor
for 3 years), Dave McLure. It was raised from people she knew, people who were
investing in HER, not the company or idea..
- You don't have to take all of your co-founders with you. Didn't face much 
trouble as solo woman co-founder (she made her husband 
 co-founder). 
- Got investment from NEA - she thought she was just getting coffee with
someone from there. NEA is the biggest venture capital firm in the world 
in terms of assets under management. 
- Had been warned by YC - "dont meet VCs during YC." 
- Lesson learnt: Sometimes the things that you think aren't a good use 
of time are (she was just "grabbing coffee" with someone from NEA) and things 
that you think are good use of time, aren't. 
- Company went bust, they had 300k left from the million in seed. 
- She fired the whole team of 12 people, she fired a co-founder. This company 
was reselling stuff bought from Amazon. 
- Had to tell her investors what she was doing. 
- First idea for next venture:"Bloomberg for startups". 
- Were jaded enough to be very close to leaving the valley. Consolidated
expenses, co-founders pre-paid rent for one whole year and decided "we'll stay 
here for 1 year and if things don't work out, we leave this town." They put a $500 
per month food budget. Convinced the apartment that they were a rich couple 
who just had a bunch of contractors going around. 
- MatterMark, luckily, found product-market fit pretty early on, and they were 
catering to VCs which is a niche market. 
- Used an app which told her how much runway she had left. Knowing that you
have only 6 months left 
- Were about to lose their apartment, 10-people team, and they got a
cease-and-desist letter from the housing co. - this is when she was raising 
Series A. 
- How did they raise series A? 
--> Came up with a list of people that they really want to work with.
--> Everyone either said no, or some said yes in a way that didn't work 
for them. 
--> Had 2.5 months of runway. One of their customers, who was a VC, 
gave them $500k - this gave them runway. Another seed..
After that, NEA and Andressen came in - "this is not a Series A, 
but we ended up getting $3.5mn" (is this reflective of the herd 
mentality among VCs?)
- What were the terms of the deal? 
--> You can keep raising on notes, as long as they dont exceed 25% of the 
company. 

Key Takeaway: Reality is far from what you read in the press. The press shows 
"raised $6.5mn". The inside story is always messy, and thats OK.
